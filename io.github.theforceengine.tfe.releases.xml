            <p>This release improves moddability by externalizing previously hard-coded data into ExternalData/DarkForces/ and allows for many properties of effects, pickups, projectiles, and weapons to be changed. In addition, first pass scripting integration has been implemented in the form of script functions that can be called from INF. Please visit the GitHub release page for a detailed list of user-facing changes.</p>

            <p>It has been months since the last official release. While most of my work
                has been directed towards the Level Editor, there still have been a large
                number of changes and improvements that have accumulated in that time
                frame, many from contributors. Please visit the GitHub release page
                for a detailed list of user-facing changes.</p>
